# Introduction

In this guide, we will build a reusable module in Typescript and publish it as a **Node.js** package. I‚Äôve seen it being done in many different ways so I want to show you how you can use the best practices and tools out there to create your own package, step by step using **Typescript**, **Tslint**, **Prettier** and **Jest.**

This is what we are going to build:  
https://www.npmjs.com/package/my-awesome-greeter  
https://github.com/caki0915/my-awesome-greeter

# What is NPM?

Npm is the package manager for Javascript and the world biggest library of reusable software code. It‚Äôs also a great as build tool itself as I will show later on.

# Why Typescript?

As a superset to Javascript, Typescript provides optional typing and deep intellisense. When it comes to package development, this is my personal opinion:

> <mark class="xj xk nw"><strong class="it jn">I believe that all packages should be built in Typescript</strong></mark>

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl">
    <iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FSqmkZ5IdwzTP2%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&display_name=Giphy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fgifs%2Freaction-what-despicable-me-SqmkZ5IdwzTP2&image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FSqmkZ5IdwzTP2%2Fgiphy.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=giphy" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="356" width="435" title="Despicable Me Reaction GIF - Find & Share on GIPHY" class="t u v ky aj" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</figure>

Some of you might feel that strong typing decreases productivity and it‚Äôs not worth the effort to use. I can agree when it comes to small-scale projects, however, when it comes to package-development, Typescript has some serious advantages:

* More robust code and easier to maintain.
* The package can be used both for Typescript and Javascript users! If your library becomes popular there will sooner or later be a demand for type-definitions, and to write those manually is time-consuming, error-prone and harder to update.
* With type-definitions in the package, the user doesn‚Äôt have to download the types from another package.
* Strong typings are more self-documenting and makes the code more understandable.
* Even if the one using your package doesn‚Äôt use Typescript, some editors, like **Visual Studio Code** will still use the type-definitions to give the user better intellisense.

# Alright. Let‚Äôs get started!

Make sure you have the latest version of node and npm.

``` bash
node -v  
10.0.0npm -v  
6.0.0
```

# Pick a great name

This might be harder than it sounds. Package names has to be in pascal-case and in lowercase. Since there are 700k+ packages, make a quick search on https://www.npmjs.com/ to make sure your awesome name is not already taken. For the sake of this guide, I will choose the name **my-awesome-greeter,** but use a unique name so you can publish your package to npm later on **üòâ.**

# Basic Setup

Create your package folder with a suitable name

``` bash
mkdir **my-awesome-greeter** && cd **my-awesome-greeter**
```

# Create a git repository

First thing first. You need a remote git repository for your package so it can be downloaded. Creating a remote git repository is out of scope for this article but once you have done it you can use the following lines to initialize your local repository and set your remote origin.

``` bash
git init  
echo "**\# My Awesome Greeter**" >> README.md  
git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Replace **<Git Repository Url>** with ****the URL to your remote repository.

``` bash
git remote add origin **<Git Repository Url>**  __git push -u origin master
```

# Init your Package

Let‚Äôs create a **package.json** file with all default values.  
We‚Äôre going to modify this one later on.

``` bash
npm init -y
```

As the last step, we‚Äôre going to add a **.gitignore** file to the root. There‚Äôs a lot **.gitignore** templates out there but I like to keep it simple and don‚Äôt add more than you need. At the moment, we only need to ignore the **node_modules** folder.

``` bash
echo **"node_modules"** >> .gitignore
```

Awesome! We got the basics üòÉ This is how it looks like when I open the project in Visual Studio Code. From now on I will continue adding files from vscode from now on rather than using the console, but choose a style that suits you üòâ

# Add Typescript as a DevDependency

Let‚Äôs start with typescript as a dependency

``` bash
npm install --save-dev typescript
```

The flag `--save-dev` will tell NPM to install Typescript as a **devDependency**. The difference between a devDependency and a dependency is that devDependencies will only be installed when you run **npm install**, but not when the end-user installs the package.   
For example, Typescript is only needed when developing the package, but it‚Äôs not needed while using the package.

Good! Now you will see a **node_modules** folder and a **package-lock.json** in your root as well.

In order to compile Typescript we also need a **tsconfig.json** file so let‚Äôs add it to the project root:

``` json
{  
  "compilerOptions": {  
    "target": "es5",  
    "module": "commonjs",  
    "declaration": true,  
    "outDir": "./lib",  
    "strict": true  
  },  
  "include": ["src"],  
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/__tests__/*"]  
}
```

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-08hw4_EGpy3OmHwUWhH8A.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-08hw4_EGpy3OmHwUWhH8A.png)
</figure>

A lot of things is going on here, so let‚Äôs explain our config file:  
**target**: We want to compile to **es5** since we want to build a package with browser compatibility.  
**module**: Use commonjs for compatibility.  
**declaration**: When you building packages, this should be true. Typescript will then also export type definitions together with the compiled javascript code so the package can be used with both Typescript and Javascript.  
**outDir**: The javascript will be compiled to the lib folder.  
**include:** All source files in the src folder  
**exclude:** We don‚Äôt want to transpile node_modules, neither tests since these are only used during development.

# Your first code!

Now when we have the compilation set up, we can add our first line of code.  
Let‚Äôs create a `src` folder in the root and add an index.ts file:

``` bash
export const Greeter = (name: string) => `Hello ${name}`; 
```

Ok, it‚Äôs a good start. Next step is to add a build script to **package.json:**

``` bash
"build" : "tsc"
```

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*MMQ2Bqnly179jXu319rj3A.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*MMQ2Bqnly179jXu319rj3A.png)
</figure>

Now you can run the build command in the console:

``` bash
npm run build
```

And viol√°!

You will see a new **lib** folder in the root with your compiled code and type definitions!

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-Cat1X8ZnFC0hTwonH0WFA.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-Cat1X8ZnFC0hTwonH0WFA.png)
</figure>

# Ignore compiled code in git

Except for **package-lock.json**, you normally don‚Äôt want to have auto-generated files under source control. It can cause unnecessary conflicts, every time it‚Äôs is autogenerated. Let‚Äôs add the lib folder to .gitignore:

``` bash
node_modules  
/lib
```

The slash before lib means ‚ÄúIgnore only the lib folder in the top of the root‚Äù This is what we want in this case.

# Formatting and Linting

An awesome package should include strict rules for linting and formatting. Especially if you want more collaborators later on. Let‚Äôs add **Prettier** and **TsLint!**

Like Typescript, these are tools used only for the development of the package. They should be added as **devDependencies**:

``` bash
npm install --save-dev prettier tslint tslint-config-prettier
```

**tslint-config-prettier** is a preset we need since it prevents conflicts between tslint and prettiers formatting rules.

In the root, add a **tslint.json**:

``` json
{  
   "extends": ["tslint:recommended", "tslint-config-prettier"]  
}
```

And a **.prettierrc**

``` json
{  
  "printWidth": 120,  
  "trailingComma": "all",  
  "singleQuote": true  
}
```

Finally, add the **lint-** and **format** scripts to **package.json**

``` json 
"format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"src/**/*.js\"",  
"lint": "tslint -p tsconfig.json"
```

Your **package.json** should now look something like this:

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9w-9-ZvsKCCoXxm2ahX46A.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9w-9-ZvsKCCoXxm2ahX46A.png)
</figure>

Now you can run **npm run lint** and **npm run format** in the console:

``` bash
npm run lint  
npm run format
```

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*dHknSd2ptmxb6qlQEMuvLA.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dHknSd2ptmxb6qlQEMuvLA.png)
</figure>

# Don‚Äôt include more than you need in your package!

In our **.gitignore** file, we added `/lib` since we don‚Äôt want the build-files in our git repository. The opposite goes for a published package. We don‚Äôt want the source code, **only** the build-files!

This can be solved in two ways. One way is to blacklist files/folders in a **.npmignore** file. Should have looked something like this in our case:

``` bash
src  
tsconfig.json  
tslint.json  
.prettierrc
```

However, blacklisting files is not a good practice. Every new file/folder added to the root, needs to be added to the **.npmignore** file as well! Instead, you should **whitelist** the files /folders you want to publish. This can be done by adding the **files** property in **package.json:**

``` bash
‚Äúfiles‚Äù: [‚Äúlib/**/*‚Äù]
```

That‚Äôs it! Easy üòÉ Only the lib folder will be included in the published package! (**README.md** and **package.json** are added by default).

For more information about whitelisting vs blacklisting in NPM packages see [this post from the NPM blog](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/165769683050/publishing-what-you-mean-to-publish). (Thank you

# Setup Testing with Jest

An awesome package should include unit tests! Let‚Äôs add [**Jest**](https://facebook.github.io/jest/): An awesome testing framework by Facebook.

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*pm9uFbR7NxtVmbyXGBQEkA.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/616/1*pm9uFbR7NxtVmbyXGBQEkA.png)
    <figcaption class="lg lh cz cx cy li lj ce b fa cg gr" data-selectable-paragraph="">Jest: A testing framework by Facebook</figcaption>
</figure>

Since we will be writing tests against our typescript source-files, we also need to add `[ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest)` and `@types/jest`. The test suite is only used during development so let‚Äôs add them as **devDependencies**

``` bash
npm install --save-dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
```

Cool! Now we need to configure Jest. You can choose to write a `jest` section to **package.json** or to create a separate config file. We are going to add it in a separate file, so it will not be included when we publish the package.

Create a new file in the root and name it **jestconfig.json:**

``` json
{  
  "transform": {  
    "^.+\\.(t|j)sx?$": "ts-jest"  
  },  
  "testRegex": "(/__tests__/.*|(\\.|/)(test|spec))\\.(jsx?|tsx?)$",  
  "moduleFileExtensions": ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "json", "node"]  
}
```

Remove the old test script in **package.json** and change it to:

``` json
"test": "jest --config jestconfig.json",
```

The **package.json** should look something like this:

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*TGomRekCAxgj_ZCDKIUjDQ.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*TGomRekCAxgj_ZCDKIUjDQ.png)
</figure>

# Write a basic test

It‚Äôs time to write our first test! üòÉ

In the `src` folder, add a new folder called `__tests__` and inside, add a new file with a name you like, but it has to end with `test.ts`, for example `Greeter.test.ts`

``` Typescript
import { Greeter } from '../index';

test('My Greeter', () => {  
  expect(Greeter('Carl')).toBe('Hello Carl');  
});
```

Ok, so the only thing we are doing here is to verify that Our method `Greeter` will return `Hello Carl` if the input is `Carl`.

Now, Try to run

``` bash
npm test
```

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">
    ![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*M3fP4j97jMmURFCz4rM1Og.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*M3fP4j97jMmURFCz4rM1Og.png)
</figure>

Cool it works! As you can see we passed one test.

# Use the magic scripts in NPM

For an awesome package, we should of course automate as much as possible. We‚Äôre about to dig into some scripts in npm: **prepare**, **prepublishOnly**, **preversion**, **version** and **postversion**

**prepare** will run both BEFORE the package is packed and published, and on local `npm install`. Perfect for running building the code. Add this script to **package.json**

``` bash
"prepare" : "npm run build"
```

**prepublishOnly** will run BEFORE **prepare** and ****ONLY on `**npm publish**`. Here we will run our test and lint to make sure we don‚Äôt publish bad code:

``` bash
"prepublishOnly" : "npm test && npm run lint"
```

**preversion** will run before bumping a new package version. To be extra sure that we‚Äôre not bumping a version with bad code, why not run lint here as well? üòÉ

``` bash
"preversion" : "npm run lint"
```

**Version** will run after a new version has been bumped. If your package has a git repository, like in our case, a commit and a new version-tag will be made every time you bump a new version. This command will run BEFORE the commit is made. One idea is to run the formatter here and so no ugly code will pass into the new version:

``` bash
"version" : "npm run format && git add -A src"
```

**Postversion** will run after the commit has been made. A perfect place for pushing the commit as well as the tag.

``` bash
"postversion" : "git push && git push --tags"
```

This is how my scripts section in **package.json** looks like:

``` json
"scripts": {  
   "test": "jest --config jestconfig.json",  
   "build": "tsc",  
   "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"src/**/*.js\"",  
   "lint": "tslint -p tsconfig.json",  
   "prepare": "npm run build",  
   "prepublishOnly": "npm test && npm run lint",  
   "preversion": "npm run lint",  
   "version": "npm run format && git add -A src",  
   "postversion": "git push && git push --tags"  
}
```

# Finishing up package.json

It‚Äôs finally time to finish up our awesome package! First, we need to make some changes to our **package.json** again:

``` json
{  
   "name": "my-awesome-greeter",  
   "version": "1.0.0",  
   **"description": "A nice greeter",**  
  ** "main": "lib/index.js",  
   "types": "lib/index.d.ts",**  
   "scripts": {  
      "test": "jest --config jestconfig.json",  
      "build": "tsc",  
      "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\" \"src/**/*.js\"",  
      "lint": "tslint -p tsconfig.json",  
      "prepare": "npm run build",  
      "prepublishOnly": "npm test && npm run lint",  
      "preversion": "npm run lint",  
      "version": "npm run format && git add -A src",  
      "postversion": "git push && git push --tags"  
   },  
   "repository": {  
     "type": "git",  
     "url": "git+https://github.com/caki0915/my-awesome-greeter.git"  
   },  
  ** "keywords": ["Hello", "Greeter"],  
   "author": "C-J",**  
   ....
```

Se here we are adding a nice description, an author and some relevant keywords. The key **main** is important here since it will tell **npm** where it can import the modules from.  
The key **types** will ****tell Typescript and Code-editors where we can find the type definitions!

# Commit and push your code to git

Time to push all your work to your remote repository! If you haven‚Äôt committed your latest code already, now it is the time to do it. üòâ

``` bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Setup Package"  
git push
```

# Publish you package to NPM!

In order to publish your package, you need to create an NPM account.   
If you don‚Äôt have an account you can do so on https://www.npmjs.com/signup  
or run the command: `npm adduser`

If you already have an account, run `npm login` to login to you NPM account.

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">

    <figcaption class="lg lh cz cx cy li lj ce b fa cg gr" data-selectable-paragraph="">Logging in to my existing NPM account</figcaption>
</figure>

Alright! Now run publish.

``` bash
npm publish
```

As you can see the package will first be built by the **prepare** script, then **test** and **lint** will run by the **prepublishOnly** script before the package is published.

<figure class="hg hh hi hj hk hl cx cy paragraph-image">

</figure>

# View your package

Now browse your package on **npmjs.** The url is ****https://npmjs.com/package/**<your-package-name>** in my case it is  ****[**https://npmjs.com/package/my-awesome-greeter**](https://npmjs.com/package/my-awesome-greeter)

</figure>

Nice! We got a package üòé üì¶ looking good so far!

# Bumping a new version

Let‚Äôs bump a new patch version of the package:

``` bash
npm version patch
```

Our **preversion**, **version,** and **postversion** will run, create a new tag in git and push it to our remote repository. Now publish again:

``` bash
npm publish
```

And now you have a new version

# What's next?

For the scope of this tutorial, I would like to stop here for now on something I would call a _‚Äúminimum setup for an NPM Package‚Äù._ However, when your package grows I would recommend:

* Setup automated build with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)
* Analyze code-coverage with [Codecov](https://codecov.io/)
* Add badges to your readme with [Shields](http://shields.io/). Everyone loves badges üòé

But let‚Äôs leave that for another tutorial.

# Good luck building your awesome package! üòÉ
